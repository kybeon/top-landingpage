# This is going to be a landing page for a random business using html and css.

#
# Felt super hard to do this without checking other people projects
# Will return to this when I feel more confident
#
# To do: Revisit flexbox, simplify code and improve css classes
# Had trouble on section one w/ the hero banner and cta. 
# Remember to use wrappers next time.
